Rev-share means you earn a share of the game’s revenue when people play in your Telegram group.

📌 Here’s how it works:

You add the RPS Titans bot to your group.

When players play games in your group, the bot collects a small fee.

You earn a percentage of that fee — automatically.

It’s like getting paid every time someone plays! 🎯
No extra work needed. Just invite the bot and let the games begin.
🚀 Ready to earn from your group’s activity? `,

1. ➕ Add this bot to your Telegram group.

Once you do that, we’ll automatically detect your group and process your request. Please note: Revenue share is currently supported for public groups (those with a Telegram @username).

We’ll notify you here once your request is reviewed. 🚀`,
